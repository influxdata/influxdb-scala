The v1 client libraries for InfluxDB were typically developed and maintained by
community members. They have all now been succeeded by v2 client libraries.
They are being archived it in favor of the v2 client library. See
https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-scala/issues/7.

If there are still users of this v1 client library, and they or somebody else
are willing to keep them updated with security fixes at a minimum please reach
out on the [Community Forums](https://community.influxdata.com/) or
[InfluxData Slack](https://influxdata.com/slack).
